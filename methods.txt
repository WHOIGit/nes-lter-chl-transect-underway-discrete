# Underway science seawater supplied by impeller pump
During six NES-LTER cruises performed on the R/V Endeavor, an impeller pump located near the ship’s bow collects water from 5 m below the ocean’s surface through a system of PVC tubing throughout the ship called the underway system. No strainers or filters are installed. The science seawater tubing is backflushed with fresh water after each cruise. The seawater is usually allowed to flow for a number of minutes (3 to 15) before data acquisition begins. The seawater passes through a debubbler (SUNY) before flowing through the fluorometers and other sensors of the underway system. The fluorometers are physically cleaned periodically as deemed necessary, often before and sometimes during a cruise depending on water quality changes or request from a scientist. 
# Discrete Chl-a measurements
Discrete underway samples were collected from a spigot connected to the underway system so that the samples contained water that had just run through the two fluorometers. Before collection, date and time of sampling were recorded along with the current fluorometer readings. 10 to 20 samples were collected on a random timeline during the cruise while making sure to collect about half each during day and a night, to address effects of nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ; Marra, 1997, Holm-Hansen et al., 2000). NPQ is a physiological acclimation mechanism affecting the fluorescence - Chl-a relationship due to the depression of the fluorescence signal in surface waters during daylight and especially at noon (Xing et al., 2012, Carberry et al., 2019). During nighttime the intensity of in vivo fluorescence is linearly correlated to Chl-a concentration, while during daytime, especially around noon, fluorescence intensity underestimates Chl-a concentration. Note that this phenomenon is decreased in winter compared to summer. Additional care was taken to maximize the dynamic range of Chl-a concentration measured, based on the live observations of the fluorescence signals. 
A collection container with a volume between 500 mL and 1 L was rinsed three times with underway water before filling. Triplicate 152 mL samples were then taken from the underway water system. Immediately after collection, the entire volume of each triplicate was filtered onto a Whatman GF/F 25 mm diameter filter using gentle vacuum (not exceeding 200 mBar) in a light limited environment to avoid any degradation of Chl-a pigments. Each filter was placed in glass tubes containing 6 mL 95% ethanol, capped, and stored in the dark at room temperature to extract the Chl-a for approximately 12 hours (+/- 2 hours). After the extraction period, each tube was vortexed for 10 seconds and the filters were removed. The fluorescence of the samples was recorded from a Turner 10AU fluorometer first as is, and then with the addition of acid to correct for and quantify phaeopigments (Wasmund ed al. 2006). Tubes were measured 30 seconds to one hour after acidification. Before and after each batch of samples, a blank, a blank + acid, and a solid standard were measured. During these 6 NES-LTER cruises, 12 to 22 samples were taken in triplicate. The extraction method followed Graff and Rynearson (2011), which omits freezing the filters in order to avoid degradation of Chl-a during frozen storage. We used 95% ethanol as a solvent (Wasmund et al. 2006). The same method for Chl-a filtration, extraction and measurement was used in many prior analyses, including Marrec et al. (2021).
The underway discrete Chl-a concentrations were calculated from the fluorescence (Fo) and the fluorescence after acidification (Fa) and are reported, for each cruise, in the nes-lter-underway-chla-en6XX.csv tables based on the coefficients Fs and r, obtained from in-lab fluorometer’s calibrations, performed before each cruise based on pure Chl-a standards (Sigma-Aldrich, from Anacystis nidulans algae). Fs is the slope of the calibration and r is the average of the ratio of corrected Fo to Fa during the in-lab calibration. For each cruise, a en6XX_uw_discrete_cont_match.csv file gathering the discrete Chl-a values and the matched continuous fluorescence from both fluorometers (described below) was created and are available in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/amandaherbst/nes-lter-chla-post-calibration/).
# Post-calibration of the fluorometers
The underway impeller-supplied water flows through two fluorometers, a WETLabs ECO-FLRTD and a WETStar fluorometer, and fluorescence is measured and recorded every second along the ship track. The WETLabs ECO-FLRTD reads Chl-a fluorescence by exciting with a 460 nm wavelength, the WETStar fluorometer with a 470 nm, and both fluorometers read emissions at 695 nm. The raw fluorescence is recorded in Volts and then converted to Chl-a concentration in µg L-1 based on a manufacturer calibration, performed before each cruise, using a scale factor and clean water/dark counts. Ship-provided 1-min temporal resolution data with raw fluorescence (in Volt) and manufacturer-calibrated fluorescence (in µg L-1) for each cruise are available through NES-LTER REST API. The manufacturer-calibrated values are referred hereafter to continuous fluorescence expressed in relative fluorescence units (r.f.u.) instead of µg L-1 before the post-calibration. 
The continuous fluorescence and discrete Chl-a data were matched with each other using a Matlab (v2021b) script (match_uw_discrete_continuous.m). Linear regressions (Model I least square fit, fitlm function) were then applied between the matched continuous fluorescence and the discrete Chl-a values. Six different matching time intervals were considered in the process due to the potential delay between the sensor reading and sample capture: exact same time, and several ranges involving lag phases: exact minus two minutes, exact minus one minute, exact plus one minute, and the average of the fluorescence from plus to minus one minute and minus two minutes to exact time. The average of plus to minus one minute time interval was chosen based on the maximum average R2 value of the regressions performed for each cruise.
Once the matching interval was defined, the two fluorometers were compared against each other to determine the best fluorometer data for each cruise. The selection of the preferred fluorometer for each cruise was made on the maximum R2 values obtained from the linear regression between the discrete Chl-a and the corresponding continuous fluorescence. The R2 values obtained with the WETStar fluorometer were on average 16% higher than the R2 values obtained with the WETLabs ECO-FLRTD, except for the EN644 cruise where the WETLabs ECO-FLRTD had a higher R2 and therefore better fit. The slope and the intercept obtained from the preferred fluorometer were then used to post-calibrate the continuous fluorescence into continuous Chl-a values using a Matlab script (post_calibration.m).
For each a cruise, an en6XX_post_cal_fluo.csv table was created from the ship-provided 1-min temporal resolution underway data available through NES-LTER REST API. The tables contain all data collected between instrument start and stop for the entirety of the cruise. Date_time_utc, and latitude and longitude from the Furuno GPS were retrieved directly from the ship-provided 1-min temporal resolution underway data files. The depth was fixed at 5 meters, which correspond to intake of the water by the impeller pump. The fluorescence_manufacturer_cal corresponds to the continuous fluorescence (aka manufacturer calibrated underway Chl-a) recorded by the preferred fluorometer, while the fluorescence_post_cal is the final post-calibrated 1-min product obtained from the coefficients of the linear regressions. The files were obtained from the post_calibration.m Matlab script with as input the 1-min underway data available through NES-LTER REST-API and the en6XX_uw_discrete_cont_match.csv. All scripts are available in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/amandaherbst/nes-lter-chla-post-calibration/).
# Quality Control
Post-calibration of the underway fluorescence was not possible for the winter 2018 (EN608) or summer 2018 (EN617) cruises because no discrete underway Chl-a samples were collected. Such discrete sampling was initiated in winter 2019 (EN627), but the quality of those data on that cruise was questionable.
We provide a column in each data table to indicate quality using IODE Primary Level flags 1 good; 2 not evaluated, not available or unknown; 3 questionable/suspect; 4 bad; 9 missing data.
For discrete underway Chl-a data, quality was flagged automatically based on the ratio between the fluorescence before (Fo) and after (Fa) acidification using the discrete_data_quality_check.m Matlab script. Quality-checked nes-lter-underway-chla-qc-en6xx.csv files were then created and stored in the nes-lter-underway-chla-qc_csv_files folder (also in https://github.com/amandaherbst/nes-lter-chla-post-calibration/). These ratios are supposed to be relatively stable for a given cruise and season, but can vary depending on the phytoplankton community composition. We observed that these ratios varied within a +/- 1 Standard Deviation around the mean value based on manual quality checked performed by an expert. Each discrete measurement with a Fo/Fa ratio out of this interval is flagged as questionable/suspect (IODE Primary Level flags = 3). Overall, we flagged 30% (+/- 4%) of the discrete underway Chl-a data as questionable. Only discrete underway Chl-a values with a IODE Primary Level flags = 1 were considered for the post-calibration. For the en661 cruise, the discrete underway Chl-a values obtained during the first 2 days (12 = 4 x 3 triplicate values) were flagged as questionable as the fluorescence values these days could not be considered for the post-calibration. The last triplicate discrete samples of the en655 cruise were manually flagged as questionable because of major discrepancies between the fluorescence recorded and the measured Chl-a concentrations.
For the continuous post-cal data, automated quality control was applied for the final data product. The first and last five minutes were given a questionable flag since the fluorometer is just getting warmed up or powering down. Any post-calibrated fluorescence data that was negative was given a bad data flag since it is impossible to have negative Chl-a concentration. Additional quality control was applied to cruise EN661 as we knew that the WETStar fluorometer was malfunctioning for 2 days before it could be cleaned. However, we could not determine whether the values obtained with the other fluorometer would be better, as these values strongly deviated from the expected Chl-a values suggested by the discrete samples.
# Data package assembly and additional quality assurance
Code for data package assembly, including concatenating data tables across cruises and adding metadata from templates, is available on GitHub (https://github.com/WHOIGit/nes-lter-chl-transect-underway-discrete). We ensured that the geographic and temporal coverage were within expected ranges and plotted values for visual inspection.
